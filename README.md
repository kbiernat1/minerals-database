first standalone application project based on REST API technology, still under construction. 

The index page leads the user through two possible paths - first, through the login process, leads to the admin panel, in which, based on the CRUD model, the administrator can add, delete or edit items (minerals) in the database. Second, intended for an ordinary user, leads to search engines. 

The search engine is based on 7 windows representing the characteristics of the mineral being searched for, but does not require the user to know each one of them. If the user knows only about the color of the stone he has, the search engine will return all minerals that share the same color.

The project is related to my hobby connected with searching and collecting minerals found in nature. There were many times when I tried to find out the name of the found stone, but none of the search engines known to me gave satisfactory results. Hence the idea to combine my first project with my hobby.
